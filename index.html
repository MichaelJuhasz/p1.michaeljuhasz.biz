				<h2>Bio</h2>
				<p>Sometimes I live in the country<br/>
				   Sometimes I live in the town<br/>
				   Sometimes I have a great notion</p>
				<p>
				   But the Charles just isn't the Mississippi, or even the Wakonda Auga River and my father gave a lot more inches than Henry Stamper.  So it was with as long a leash as you can imagine that I roamed far from my father's field of software engineering, ranged over and then down into subjects less studied by my most immediate relatives; mostly religious studies, in that social scientific sense.  Which is how I wound up on this side of the country and in a more round about way, at this desk at a library on the other side of the Harvard campus.</p>
				<p>A very long leash perhaps, but those family ties do bind, and even if they're not barbed and spined, they can hold us close forever.  For that reason, or perhaps because I thought it might be necessary, in this life or the next, to have something like a marketable skill set, I thought I'd give computer science a try.</p>
